# Markdown Notes App 📝

This is a simple one-day project I built to play around with **React**, **Vite**, **Firebase** and a bit of **Docker**.
The idea is pretty basic – an online notes app where you can log in, create notes in **Markdown**, and have them saved in the cloud.

## Features

- 🔐 Login with Google (Firebase Auth)
- 🗒 Create, edit and delete notes
- ✍ Live Markdown preview
- ☁ Store all notes in Firebase Firestore
- 🎨 Styled with Tailwind CSS
- 🐳 Optional Docker setup so you can run it easily
